# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide for RSA Backend

## âœ… Current Status
Your Node.js backend is now successfully uploaded to GitHub at: `https://github.com/RohitRB/rsa-backend.git`

All sensitive files have been removed from the repository and the code is ready for Railway deployment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Railway Deployment

### Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [https://railway.app/](https://railway.app/)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. You'll be redirected to the Railway dashboard

### Step 2: Create New Project
1. Click **"New Project"** button
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose your repository: `RohitRB/rsa-backend`
4. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Once your project is created, go to the **Variables** tab and add these environment variables:

#### Required Variables:
```env
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_yYGWUPovOauhOx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=m5wQh8cIXTJ92UJeoHhwtLxa
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://sisodiayashaswi7:Yashaswi1225@@@cluster0.sinn5wt.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

#### Firebase Configuration:
Add your Firebase service account key as a variable:
1. Open your `kalyan-rsa-backend-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-af5b9f8c2e.json` file
2. Copy the entire JSON content
3. In Railway Variables, add:
   - **Variable Name**: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
   - **Value**: Paste the entire JSON content (the whole file)

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Railway will automatically start building your project
2. You can monitor the build process in the **Deployments** tab
3. Once successful, you'll get a live URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Step 5: Test Your Deployment
Test these endpoints to ensure everything is working:

1. **Health Check**: `GET https://your-app-name.railway.app/`
   - Should return: "Firebase backend is running!"

2. **Admin Dashboard**: `GET https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/dashboard`
   - Should return dashboard statistics

3. **Create Order**: `POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/create-order`
   - Test with: `{"amount": 100}`

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files

Your project includes these Railway-specific files:

### railway.json
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### package.json
- Contains all necessary dependencies
- Includes start script: `"start": "node index.js"`
- Includes dev script: `"dev": "nodemon index.js"`

### .gitignore
- Excludes sensitive files from Git
- Prevents secrets from being committed

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Your Deployment

### Railway Dashboard Features:
- **Real-time Logs** - Monitor application logs
- **Performance Metrics** - CPU, memory usage
- **Deployment History** - Track all deployments
- **Environment Variables** - Manage configuration
- **Custom Domains** - Add your own domain

### Health Checks:
- Railway automatically checks your `/` endpoint
- If health check fails, Railway will restart your app
- Monitor health check status in the dashboard

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### 1. Build Failures
**Problem**: Build fails during deployment
**Solution**: 
- Check Railway build logs
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

#### 2. Environment Variables Missing
**Problem**: App crashes with "missing environment variable" error
**Solution**:
- Double-check all environment variables are set in Railway
- Verify variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure Firebase service account key is complete JSON

#### 3. Firebase Connection Error
**Problem**: Cannot connect to Firebase
**Solution**:
- Verify Firebase service account key is correct
- Check Firebase project settings
- Ensure Firestore is enabled in your Firebase project

#### 4. Payment Processing Issues
**Problem**: Razorpay payments fail
**Solution**:
- Verify Razorpay keys are correct
- Check if using live/test keys appropriately
- Monitor payment verification logs

#### 5. CORS Issues
**Problem**: Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solution**:
- Update frontend environment variables with Railway URL
- Check CORS configuration in backend
- Verify Railway URL is accessible
